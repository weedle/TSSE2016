				Why hello there! My name is Motus the Wizard! I can cast magic spells and enchantments to weave chaos and order
				throughout the fabric of the universe. I then use the ensuing effects to create small magical stones that I sell
				for a pittance to power your laser beams. This is my life now. Selling magical rocks for pennies. Great wizard Motus.
