			DialogueRegular = "Why hello there! My name is Motus the wizard! I can cast magic spells and enchantments to weave chaos and order throughout the fabric of the universe. I then use the ensuing effects to create small magical stones that I sell for a pittance to power your laser beams. This is my life now. Selling magical rocks for pennies. Great wizard Motus."
